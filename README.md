# the Polywog Collection 

The Polywog Collection is a project inspired by the black and latinx engineering students of the NYU Tandon School of Engineering. 

This project will result in a comprehensive web experience that showcases **all** images of black and latinx students groups found in the
Polywog yearbooks, circa 1887-2009, and the accompanying apparel designs, titled "the Polywog Collection". This project is currently in
it's MVP state and is set to debut at the 2020 IDM Showcase. Project development will continue following the IDM Showcase and with the site
and apparel recieving at least one more iteration, to be completed by the end of 2020. 

## Future Site Development

The following list consists of future work to be done, this list will be iterated throughout the course of development: 
1. Ensure site is accessible according to WCAG Standards 
2. Add next and previous buttons to both product and grid modal 
3. Create thumbnail sized images for the banner
4. Have banner swap images out as they fade out
5. Merge JS codebase 
6. Banner Images on hover: Make Opacity 1
7. Consider Site Loading screen until home + archive loaded
8. Do things with NYU (secret hehehe)
