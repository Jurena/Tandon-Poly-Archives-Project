Re Image: What you want is the same column space between columns and rows 
	vertical images push down the row
	crop the image veritcally, center 

Background color applied to the images of apparel, your eye needs to adjust and make the apparel unblend
rather than using a frame, you can add a background

youre not trying to make these images better, right now my concern should be making these folks fit into a square 

It's always an 80/20. What's the level of effort? Do you really improve enormously the experience
the things you do at the end can get surgical 

to fix the images, try to anchor them to the top of the image and maybe work your way down 
start by: seeing what the grid looks like when all the squares 

re: 12 images on tha apprel end, dont worry about that now, worry about how to make the apparel stand out with colorm, the sameness 
of your apparel design is what folks are going to immediately notice, so you need to do something to distinguish 
one from the other
(Chose two+ (two miught be too checkerboard-y) colors and alternate them, do something that allows me to know that 
each individual apparel are different childs., Ultimately as Im scrolling down 


Has a sense of what can be done programmatically to solve a visual problem. What you do is think structure, and try to 
understand how the other people work

Modal in the first section is actually a gallery: you may want to include a magnifying function within the modal 
you must serve a higher resolution image anyways so to have users take advantage of that you can do a slide, a magnifying
glass, whatever. The only way to  see faces in a alot of these is to zoom in

If im already on a t-shirt and I click on the button, you want to go into the detail of that particularly

Think of the user path: If im in the gallery and I choose to click, that means that I want more information about that. It should be
that the only anchoring is the navigation that follows you, not click through an image, to be taken to a seperate grid, to then be taken to 
another modal (very zig-zag) 

Have an arrow pointing down in the banner to anchor 

Always use the laptop as the fullest width

Make the navbar larger, it needs to be more generous, padding between the navbar and the image grid so things dont collide

Should the navbar on mobile be hidden in a hamburger menu

You could also do floating, sticky elements that float on top of the page and that you can expand that contains the nav elements
